This repository contains FEMM code to simulate LVDT and VC systems. It is based on the code developed by F. Schimmel at Nikhef. In this case we are using the pyFEMM package to interface the FEMM functions with python. This way we can use python files and notebooks to easily simulate, analyse and plot the results without the need for software like Labview. Unfortunately, as FEMM is only available on Windows operating systems the repository python code will only work on Windows systems with FEMM installed.

Below you will find some short instruction on how to install and setup the software. This content is under construction.

1. Install the FEMM software on your Windows machine: https://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage
Go to download page and follow instructions.

2. Assuming you have a working python 3 environment, install pyFEMM: https://www.femm.info/wiki/pyFEMM
You can do this with pip via: pip install pyfemm
On the linked page you can also find the pyFEMM manual.

3. Set environment to use pyFEMM with the FEMM executable:

4. Clone this repository on your local computer to get access to all jupyter notebooks.
